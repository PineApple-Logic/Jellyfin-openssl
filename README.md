# JellyfinSSL-Script
This script is there to help you setup https for Jellyfin.

If you want to use Apache instead of nginx, then do the same process below however,
With the ssl-apache.sh instead of ssl-nginx.sh

NB: In order for this to work you need to have access to port fowarding on your router.

SETUP:

git clone https://github.com/PineApple-Logic/JellyfinSSL-Script.git

cd JellyfinSSL-Script/

chmod +x ssl-nginx.sh

./ssl-nginx.sh

Done
